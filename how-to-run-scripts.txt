How to run scripts (for scraping, etc):
1. Navigate to the top-level directory (with api/, README.md, requirements.txt, etc).
2. Run the command "python -m api.scripts.<scriptname>" where 'scriptname' does NOT include the '.py' extension.
3. The above command runs the script from a package environment, allowing it to import the database from the api package.
4. You can include any script arguments after the command (just like you normally would).
