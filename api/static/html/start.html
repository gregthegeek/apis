	<p>To access Brown's data, you'll need a <em>Client ID</em>. Your Client ID will be included with every request you make to the API. It's sort of like your secret key to all of the data we provide (so don't share it with other developers!).</p>

	<p>Once you have your Client ID, you can begin requesting data from our various APIs. Our base URL is "api.students.brown.edu".

	<p>These requests and all their different arguments can become very confusing. That's why we provide detailed documentation for you to reference. Some APIs also have language-specific libraries to make it even easier to make requests. For example, the Dining API has a Python library that helps simplify API requests. You can find documentation and a list of all these libraries on our <a id="resources">resources page</a>.</p>
