<article>
	<p>To access Brown's data, you'll need a <em>Client ID</em>. Your Client ID will be included with every request you make to the API. It's sort of like your secret key to all of the data we provide (so don't share it with other developers!).</p>

<article>
	<p>Once you have your Client ID, you can begin requesting data from our various APIs. For instance, the following URL will return a JSON object representing the current number of people in the Ratty:</p>
</article>

<br />

<p class='codeExample'>https://api.students.brown.edu/wifi/count?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID&location=ratty</p>

<article>
	<p>Let's break down that URL. The "https" ensures we've established a secure connection to the API (i.e. the request is private and cannot be viewed by other sneaky listeners on the network). The next bit, "api.students.brown.edu", is our <em>base URL</em> with which every single requests begins (and it's also our website home page!). After that, "wifi/count" names the current API we're accessing (as opposed to "dining" or other APIs) and a specific endpoint supported by that API. After the question mark, we include certain arguments to add more detail to our request. Every request will require your Client ID. This request also requires a location where it should count the current number of people.</p>

	<p>These requests and all their different arguments can become very confusing. That's why we provide <a id="documentation">detailed documentation</a> for you to reference. Some APIs also have language-specific libraries to make it even easier to make requests. For example, the Dining API has a Python library that helps simplify API requests. You can find a list of all these libraries on our <a id="resources">resources page</a>.</p>
