How to Get Started

1. Clone this repository to your own machine
2. If you don't have 'pip' installed, install 'pip' (find instructions online)
3. Also, make sure you have 'virtualenv' installed (find instructions online)
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the top level of the reposity (api/, requirements.txt, Procfile, etc)
5. Run 'virtualenv venv' and then 'source venv/bin/activate' (you're now in a virtual environment!)
6. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (this installs all the required libraries in your virtual environment)
7. Check out 'how-to-run-scripts.txt' and 'how-to-connect-to-mongo.txt' for more information
8. If you ever want to deactivate the virtual environment, just run "deactivate" in the terminal
