Toward the bottom of 'api/__init__.py', a connection will be made to MongoDB in order to read and write to the database. In order to connect, the program will use the 'MONGO_URI' environment variable (rather than hardcoding this URI into the codebase). 

How to set the environment variable on OSX Mavericks/Yosemite:
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the Brown APIs package. (cd ~/projects/api)
2. If you're using a virtual environment, activate it. (source venv/bin/activate)
3. Enter 'export MONGO_URI="this_is_where_you_put_the_URI_with_username_and_password"'.
4. Enter 'env' and check to see that the variable was added correctly.
5. Run and test the server by running 'python run.py'.

You can get the actual Mongo URI by asking Joe for access to the database.
